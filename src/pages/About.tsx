              <p>
                {APP_NAME} was founded in 2023 by a team of pet lovers and technology experts who 
                experienced firsthand the challenges of managing pet food allergies. After months of 
                trial and error with their own pets, they decided to create a solution that would 
                make the process easier for pet owners everywhere.

                Today, {APP_NAME} helps thousands of pet owners identify allergens, track symptoms, 
                and find suitable food options for their pets with allergies.
